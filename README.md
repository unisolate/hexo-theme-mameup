# mameup
A [Hexo](http://hexo.io) theme based on [mame](https://github.com/chadluo/hexo-theme-mame). Forked from [rwxes](https://github.com/rwxes/hexo-theme-mame), which is an improved version with light responsiveness, a few style changes and SpinKit loader.

Color and font improvement. Better markdown apperance.

About the newly-added suffix of the theme name, "up": 'u' is for "Uni", my name, and 'p' is for "Press", an Android app with awesome design that gave me the idea of color theme.

[Demo](http://ohmyuni.com).
